### Using Milestones

Milestones are used to group issues and pull requests together to provide a clear overview of the project's progress. When submitting or reviewing issues, please consider the following guidelines related to milestones:

1. Assigning Milestones: When creating or reviewing an issue, consider whether it aligns with any existing milestones. If it does, please assign the appropriate milestone to the issue to ensure it is properly tracked.

2. Creating New Milestones: If you believe that a new milestone is necessary to better organize and track the project's progress, please consult with the project maintainers before creating a new milestone.

3. Tracking Progress: By utilizing milestones, we can collectively track progress and better understand the project's development roadmap.

4. Prioritizing Issues: Milestones can also help in prioritizing issues and feature requests, providing a clearer picture of what needs to be addressed in each development cycle.

By adhering to these guidelines, we can ensure that the use of milestones enhances the clarity and organization of our project's development process. Once a milestone is complete, we can release the next version.

### Naming conventions

When merging pull requests or creating commits, please conform to the angular commit message style, so our changelog will be updated. Namely in the form `<type>(<scope>): <subject>\n\n[body]`

* Type: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore.
* Scope: the file or group of files (not a strict right or wrong)
* Subject and body: present tense (~~changed~~change, ~~added~~add) and include motivation and contrasts with previous behavior
