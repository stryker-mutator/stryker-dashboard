## Running the project

To run the project, you need to have node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

After you have node.js installed, you can run the following commands in the root of the project:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

A storybook server will start on [localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).

## Icon pack

We use the heroicons icon pack made by the makers of tailwindcss. You can find the icons at [heroicons.com](https://heroicons.com/).

An example of how to use the icons can be found in `supported-framework-list.ts`.
